- How to Start the Visualization:

The following visualization can be started completelly offline without downloading any libraries or code. In fact the only requisite is that a local server must be runned, either with a Live Server extension or with a Python local server in order to access local files such as images in the visualization.

1. Start a Local Server on the current dir: ./Project.
2. When you access your local server you might still need to navigate to the following file `./Project/Visualization/index.html`.
3. Enjoy our Visualization!
