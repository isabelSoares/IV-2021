# The Evolution of Mobile Phones: Brands and Specs
The following project was developed for the subject of Information Visualization, lectured on the first semester of 2020 / 2021.
The goal was to develop a fully functional Visualization about a domain of our choice, the development was done completelly from scratch even including stages such as Data Processing and definition of the Visual Encondings we were gonna use.

## Introduction
With this visualization, we hope to show how the brands and models developed over time both economically and in terms of the technology and its hardware. We think this is an interesting subject because we are a technological generation and through this project, we will be able to expose the evolution of a device so crucial to our lives. Furthermore, this is a subject that is highly unexplored as of now. There is no shortage of specifications and hardware components in current technology, what is in fact missing is a tool with the potential to analyze its growth.

## How to Start the Visualization
The following visualization can be started completelly offline without downloading any libraries or code. In fact the only requisite is that a local server must be runned, either with a Live Server extension or with a Python local server in order to access local files such as images in the visualization.

1. Start a Local Server, preferably in the file `./Visualization/index.html`.
2. When you access your local server you might still need to navigate to the following file `./Visualization/index.html`
3. **Enjoy our Visualization**
